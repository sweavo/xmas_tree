# xmas_tree
RTE Team's Xmas tree

## Depends on 

* Adafruit_neopixel library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
* ws2812fx library  https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX
* rotary library https://github.com/sweavo/rotary

## Hardware

I used BTL ws2812b strip, which has a three pin connector and two flying leads for extra power (more than about 10 LEDs will overtax your Arduino's regulator), plugged into a fat power supply.

The sparkfun rotary is also plugged in. That should be documented in the rotary library (it isn't, at the time of writing)
